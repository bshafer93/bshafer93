### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Brent Shafer and welcome to my profile. Feel free to peruse any of my latest projects and experiments! 

I'm a forever learner and love dabbling in many types of programming languages. I focus most of my energy on learning back-end development, but I love to dabble with graphics programming.
