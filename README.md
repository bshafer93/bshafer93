### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Brent Shafer and welcome to my profile. Feel free to peruse any of my latest projects and experiments! 

I'm a lifelong learner and love noodling in many programming languages. I focus most of my energy on learning back-end development, but love to dabble with graphics programming too.
